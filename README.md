# Introducion
* The beginning of the semester we started with a big project. The projects purpose was to create an API. This API would be used throughout the entire semester in order to help us create what we have today. Over the course of the semester we worked with this API, from creating a backend, to learning frontend and ultimately learning to connect the two to make an interactive front end website that would List,Create,Edit and Delete items from the API.

These activities represent the growth of our API project throughout the semester.
# Activity Assignments
| Activity    | Description |
| -------- | ------- |
| Activity 0 | This activity had us do an NPM install and run a simple website for our API|
| Activity 1 | This was the biggest activity out of the bunch. In this activity we had to create an entire Rest API with a connected Database.   |
| Activity 2 | In this activity we created an Angular project to start our front end. |
| Activity 3 | We created a front end website to display our Music album |
| Activity 4 | We added an HTTP Client Module to our Music App |
| Activity 5 | This was when we started to add structure to our front end. We pulled different code from Bootstrap to help display all the information on each album |
| Activity 6 | This was a continuation of the last project. |
| Activity 7 | After creating the front end we added different API responses such as, create, edit, and view |

# Milestone Assignments
| Milestone    | Description |
| -------- | ------- |
| Milestone 1 | There was no coding involved in this milestone. We created a proposal of what our goal was going to be |
| Milestone 2 | After receiving instructor feedback we editted our project to create what our goal was |
| Milestone 3 | Like Activity 1, this was the biggest milestone in that we had to create our own database and a rest API that connected and interacted with that database. |
| Milestone 4 | We created a front end for our API code. With this milestone we wanted to display the information in our API |
| Milestone 5 | This was our finalized front end. With this website we could view,create,edit and delete any information from our API.  |

# Conclusion
The purpose of this course was to teach us both front end and back end development. With the website we created we learned how a website can interact with a Rest API and how that API interacts with a database. Each Activity and Milestone helped us slowly create a website with data.
